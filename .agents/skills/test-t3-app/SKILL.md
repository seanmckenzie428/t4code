description: Launch, retain, and test the T4 Code web app in isolated development environments, including first-try browser authentication with one-time pairing URLs, pairing-token recovery, worktree-safe state directories, cross-turn dev server lifecycle, and direct SQLite inspection or fixture seeding. Use when an agent needs to run T4 locally, iteratively test UI behavior with a human, recover from an expired or consumed pairing token, isolate dev state, or prepare test data in state.sqlite.

# Test T4 App

Use this skill for the web client. For iOS Simulator, Android Emulator, or physical-device testing against an isolated T4 backend, use the sibling [`test-t3-mobile`](../test-t3-mobile/SKILL.md) skill.

## Start the app

Reuse this task's healthy dev server. Otherwise run `vp run dev` from the
repository root and retain its terminal session. Use the worktree's ignored
`.t3` state and read the actual ports and pairing URL from the dev-runner output.
Never run against `~/.t3/userdata` or set `VITE_HTTP_URL` or `VITE_WS_URL`.

Test with meaningful project and thread data. Read
[references/sqlite-fixtures.md](references/sqlite-fixtures.md) only when
inspecting or seeding SQLite. Stop the test server before direct fixture writes.

## Use the Browser panel

Use the built-in Browser panel when available. Ask permission before browser or
computer-use verification; launching a dev server alone is not UI verification.
If panel tools are unavailable, report the gap. Use another existing automation
surface only when the user explicitly approves it; do not install one implicitly.

Call `preview_status`, then `preview_open` if the Browser panel is
closed. Navigate to the complete startup pairing URL once with
`preview_navigate`, then use `preview_snapshot` and T4's interaction tools.
If the token was consumed or expired, run `node apps/server/src/bin.ts pair`
for a fresh one. Keep using the same tab.

## Verify and retain

Exercise the affected flow and capture the state that proves it works. Keep
the server, state, and panel available while the user inspects or iterates.
An assistant turn ending is not teardown. Stop only processes you started,
using retained terminal sessions or captured PIDs.

When sharing is requested, start with `vp run dev --share` and give the user
a fresh complete pairing URL that you have not consumed. Keep other credentials
out of screenshots, commits, and replies.

### Verify a shared environment before human handoff

When another person will use the printed pairing URL and browser verification is authorized, first open the shared origin without the pairing path or fragment in the controlled browser and confirm the T4 Code app loads. This browser navigation is required even when curl succeeds because browsers block some otherwise reachable ports before making a network request.

Do not open the other person's complete pairing URL during this reachability check; doing so consumes its one-time token. If the agent also needs an authenticated browser, create and consume a separate pairing token, then leave a fresh token for the other person.

## Preserve the environment while iterating

Treat the overall testing or implementation loop—not an assistant turn or one verification pass—as the environment lifecycle boundary.

- Keep the dev process, base directory, selected ports, authenticated browser tab, registered projects, and seeded fixtures alive while the user may inspect the result or request follow-up changes.
- Do not stop the server merely because one verification pass completed or because you are yielding a response to the user.
- Before starting another environment, check whether the existing process and browser tab still serve the task. Reuse them when healthy instead of discarding useful state.
- On a later turn, verify that the existing process is alive and reuse its printed ports and base directory. If it exited, restart with the same base directory; create a new pairing token only when the browser session is no longer valid.
- Tell the user when a test environment remains available, including its non-secret web URL when useful. Include a pairing token only when the user still needs to pair (see below).

## Authenticate the browser on the first navigation

1. Wait for the server log that says authentication is required and includes a URL ending in `/pair#token=...`.
2. Use the controlled in-app browser or browser-automation surface available to the agent. Do not use a system-browser launch command during automated testing.
3. Open that complete URL exactly once as the controlled browser's first navigation. Preserve the fragment and token verbatim.
4. Wait for the pairing exchange and redirect to finish before navigating elsewhere.
5. Continue in the same browser context so its stored bearer session remains available.

Keep pairing URLs out of screenshots, committed files, and durable logs. When the user asked for a shared environment, the deliverable IS the full pairing URL — paste it in your reply, token and all; a bare origin is useless to them. A pairing token is short-lived and single-use; opening the URL in another browser or opening it twice can consume it, so never open a URL you handed to the user.

## Recover a consumed or expired pairing token

Run `node apps/server/src/bin.ts pair` from the repository root. It discovers the running dev server (worktree `.t3` first, same precedence as the dev runner) and prints a fresh `Pair URL` against the server's current web origin, including a `--share` tailnet origin. Pass `--base-dir <base-dir>` only when the server was started with `--home-dir`, using the identical path.

Tokens from `pair` carry standard client scopes. The startup pairing URL carries admin scopes; if the user needs Settings → Connections management (`access:write`), restart the server and hand over the new startup URL instead.

## Inspect or seed SQLite state

Read [references/sqlite-fixtures.md](references/sqlite-fixtures.md) before changing the database.

- Use `node apps/server/scripts/t3-sqlite-state.ts query` for schema discovery and read-only checks.
- Stop the dev server before using `node apps/server/scripts/t3-sqlite-state.ts exec`, then restart it with the same base directory.
- Seed projection tables only for disposable UI fixtures. Use application commands and APIs when testing business behavior or projection correctness.
- Use the auth CLI, not direct `auth_*` table edits, for pairing and sessions.

The helper refuses to write to the shared `~/.t3` directory by default and creates a database backup before each mutation.

## Tear down only when the testing loop is finished

Tear down when the user explicitly asks, confirms the iteration is finished, or the overall task is genuinely complete with no pending human review. Do not infer completion from the end of an assistant turn.

When teardown is appropriate:

1. Stop the dev process with its terminal interrupt.
2. Preserve the isolated base directory when it contains useful reproduction evidence or state for a likely follow-up.
3. Otherwise remove only a path created for this test after resolving and verifying the exact target.

If completion is uncertain, keep the environment alive and mention that it is retained for further iteration. A fresh isolated base directory remains the safest reset when authentication, migrations, or fixture state becomes ambiguous.

## Troubleshoot predictably

- If the browser shows an unauthenticated pairing screen, issue a new token instead of retrying the consumed URL.
- If the pairing URL is no longer visible, run `node apps/server/src/bin.ts pair` against the same base directory.
- If the replacement token is rejected, verify that the CLI and server use the identical absolute base directory and web URL.
- If the UI shows unexpected data, verify that every command uses the identical explicit base directory before editing anything.
- If ports move because another instance is running, trust the current dev-runner output rather than assuming ports `13773` and `5733`.
