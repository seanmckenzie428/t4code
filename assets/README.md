# Brand icons

The three Icon Composer projects are the source of truth for full application icons:

- `dev/app-icon.icon`
- `nightly/app-icon.icon`
- `prod/app-icon.icon`

Each project uses `text.svg` for the filled Lucide Plane mark and `background.svg` when the background is a vector layer. Additional layers use semantic names that describe their role and placement.

Run `vp run icons:export` from the repository root to regenerate the tracked iOS, Linux, Windows, and web assets. The development web exports are also copied to `apps/web/public` for the browser favicon and splash screen. Production favicons and production/nightly WebP icons are exported to the marketing app. Run `vp run icons:check` to verify that the generated assets and public copies match their sources without changing files.

Exporting requires Icon Composer 2 or newer on macOS. The script selects the newest compatible exporter from Xcode or a standalone Icon Composer installation and pins design generation 26. Set `ICON_COMPOSER_TOOL` to the full path of `Icon Composer.app/Contents/Executables/ictool` to override automatic discovery.

## macOS exports

Packaged macOS apps use the Icon Composer `.icon` source directly. On Tahoe and Golden Gate, the system renders that native icon. The tracked macOS PNGs also supply the development launcher and a fallback resource.

For modern macOS artwork, export with Platform `iOS, macOS`, Appearance `Default`, Size `1024pt`, Scale `1×`, and Design Generation `26`. Preserve the native export without resizing or compositing it. The current PNGs use these full-bleed metrics.

The automated export script leaves the macOS PNGs unchanged. Export them in Icon Composer to the following destinations:

- `dev/app-icon.icon` -> `dev/blueprint-macos-1024.png`
- `nightly/app-icon.icon` -> `nightly/nightly-macos-1024.png`
- `prod/app-icon.icon` -> `prod/black-macos-1024.png`

### Legacy macOS artwork

Icon Composer's command-line exporter does not expose the `macOS pre-Tahoe` preset. If preparing a legacy macOS PNG, use the GUI and verify its actual output geometry; some Composer versions export full-bleed artwork even with this preset selected.

After changing an Icon Composer project, open it in Icon Composer and export the macOS PNG with exactly these settings:

- Platform: `macOS pre-Tahoe`
- Appearance: `Default`
- Size: `1024pt`
- Scale: `1×`

For legacy metrics, the result must be a 1024×1024 PNG with the classic macOS safe area: the opaque icon body is 824×824, inset 100 pixels on every side, with only the native Icon Composer shadow extending into the surrounding transparent canvas. Do not treat a full-bleed export as a verified legacy icon.

To have Codex prepare legacy exports, paste this prompt into a task opened at the repository root:

```text
Use [@Computer](plugin://computer-use@openai-bundled) and the Icon Composer app to export the three macOS app icons in this repository.

For each project below, use Platform: macOS pre-Tahoe, Appearance: Default, Size: 1024pt, and Scale: 1×, then save the PNG to the exact destination:

- assets/dev/app-icon.icon -> assets/dev/blueprint-macos-1024.png
- assets/nightly/app-icon.icon -> assets/nightly/nightly-macos-1024.png
- assets/prod/app-icon.icon -> assets/prod/black-macos-1024.png

Do not resize, composite, or otherwise post-process the exported PNGs.

Verify every result is 1024×1024 and has the classic macOS safe area: an 824×824 opaque body inset 100px on every side, with only Icon Composer's native shadow extending beyond it.
```

Do not edit the generated PNG or ICO files directly.

## Android launcher and splash artwork

Android masks the central 72dp of a 108dp adaptive canvas, and the Android 12+ splash screen masks
the central two thirds of a 288dp canvas, so the Icon Composer exports cannot be used directly:
their rounded-square silhouette gets framed again and the mark is cropped. The Android artwork
is instead rendered from the same Icon Composer SVG sources by `vp run icons:export:android`:

- `apps/mobile/assets/android-icon-foreground.png`: the shared transparent mark, sized to stay
  inside the safe zone
- `apps/mobile/assets/android-icon-background-dev.png` and `-nightly.png`: full-bleed variant
  artwork (blueprint grid and annotations; night sky and clouds). Production uses a solid color.
- `apps/mobile/assets/android-splash-icon-*.png`: the two layers composed into one 288dp image, so
  the splash mask reproduces the launcher icon's framing.

Rerun the export after changing a layer SVG. The exporter also updates `android-icon-mark.png` and `android-notification-icon.png` as flat silhouettes for notifications and
Android's monochrome themed icon.

The plane silhouette comes from Lucide (ISC license); see `lucide-LICENSE`.
